# GLAB-340.4.1-List

## Introduction
In this lab, learners will create a game that involves manipulating a list. The game will present the user with a list of words, and the user must perform various operations on the list to transform it into a target list.

## Lab Overview
In this lab, we'll demonstrate how to manipulate the list. Learner should be able to perform various operations to the list by the end of this lab.

## Examples

### List Manipulation Game

***Rules of rthe game***

- [ ] The game will start by presenting the user with a list of words.
- [ ] The user will be given a target list that they must transform the original list into.
- [ ] The user can perform the following operations on the list:
- [ ] Append a word to the end of the list
- [ ] Extend the list with another list
- [ ] Concatenate two elements in the list
- [ ] Traverse the list and view its elements
- [ ] Modify an element in the list
- [ ] Insert an element at a specific index in the list
- [ ] Pop an element from the list
- [ ] Remove a specific element from the list
- [ ] Sort the list in ascending or descending order

*** Implementation***

Learners can implement the game using Python and its built-in list methods. Here are some suggestions to get started:

- Create a list of words to use as the starting point for the game.
- Create a function to generate a target list, which can be random or pre-defined.
- Create a function to display the current list and target list to the user.
- Create a function to allow the user to perform operations on the list (append, extend, etc.).
- Create a function to check if the current list matches the target list and end the game if it does.
- With these basic functions, you can create a fun and challenging game that involves manipulating Python lists using the various methods and techniques you mentioned.
